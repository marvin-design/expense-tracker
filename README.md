# 💰 Expense Tracker App

## 📝 Description

The **Expense Tracker** is a user-friendly web application designed to help you **track your spending**, **categorize expenses**, and **manage your finances** effectively.

You can:
- Add new expenses using a simple form

- Edit or delete entries as needed
- Search through your expenses in real time

The app also stores your data in your browser’s **local storage**, so your records remain saved even after refreshing or closing the tab.
